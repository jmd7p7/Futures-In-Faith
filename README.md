Futures In Faith (FIF) is a fundraising program developed for the youth group of St. Gabriel Catholic Church, Kansas City, Missouri.
FIF has successfully raised thousands of dollars for the youth at St. Gabriel. It has also been a source of time-intensive menial tasks for the program's facilitator. This application was designed to alleviate these menial tasks so time and energy could be spent on developing the program.

The most important tasks the application performs are:
  - Manages a database of youth group members, investors (donors to the program), and investments (donations to the program).
  - Provides a simple interface for the program's facilitator to enter program data into the application.
  - Generates a PDF stock certificate for each investment. 
  - Sends a thank you email to the donor for each investment entered into the system. The stock certificate associated with that investment is included in the email.
  - Generates a variety of reports for the program's facilitator.
  
This application was designed in late 2014 / early 2015. Since then I have completed two software engineering courses and a Java application course. It is in these courses that I was exposed to the principals of software design and best practices with regard to writing code. Please check out my repository called "Game" to see how I strive to incorporate these principles and practices into my current work (current as of early 2016).
